Welcome!     

This repository hosts the files used to create a Streamlit app for the project created by myself and my project partners, Kathrin and Jef. The app can be viewed at the following link: [QUIT – Global Tobacco Control · Streamlit](https://tobaccoquit.streamlit.app/)

In the ‘Project Documents’ folder, you can find the PDF of our project report, in addition to the Python code we used.
